## About The Project

This project aims to model an online streaming service by listing Movies and Seasons of TV episodes.
We scroll through the navigation bar to find

* Movies, as the list of movies in our database ordered by creation.
* Seasons, a list of seasons ordered by creation listing its episodes.
* All, listing both Movies and Seasons ordered by creation.
* Library, a list of all the purchases made by the user that are currently activated. 

The User can puchase either a Movie or a Season and it will have it in its library for two days. The user will be able to see the remaining hours of his purchases in the library.
Once an item is expired and not in his library anymore, the user will be able to purchase the same item again, but the user is not going to be able to purchase the same item twice within a two day span.
